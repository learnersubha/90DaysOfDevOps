                            ### Volume Management & Disk Usage ###

## we are learning Volume management in AWS cloud. There is a EC2 isntance present and we create 3 EBS (Elastic Block Storage) and mount the EBS in EC2.
   First we create an EC2(8 GB) instance and also create 3 EBS(6 GB,7 GB,10 GB) volumes. Now select each EBS and go to action and attach every EBS volume with EC2 instance.

# To show the volumes are attached or not
   lsblk                          ## list the block

# NOw if you want to useable the EBS volumes first you need to convert the volumes into physical volume, then need to create volume group and then we create a logical volume,
  where we can add and reduce volume desirely from the volume group. This things are maintain by LVM
  To run commands in LVM we need sudo access or we can first login into root user (sudo su) then press lvm to enter the lvm then
   

  pvcreate /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1             ## nvme1n1, nvme2n1 = EBS volume name and /dev/nvme1n1 & /dev/nvme2n1 is the extended device name
  pvs                                            ## to check the physical volume

  vgcreate ipl /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1         ## ipl = volume group name , /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 are the physical volumes to create the volume group
  vgs                                            ## To show volume group

  lvctrteate -L 9G -n mumbai_indians ipl         ## mumbai_indians = Logical volume name,   ipl = Volume group 9G = logical volume size
  lvs                                            ## To show logical volume
  lvextend -L +2G /dev/ipl/mumbai_indians        ## for extend logical volume  2G = extend size
 ## Now lvm work done.
## Now we mount the logical volumes. First need to create a directory to mount the logical volume. Then need to format the logical volume now we can mount the logical volume
  mkdir /mnt/wankhere                            ## /mnt/wankere is the directory where the logical volume mount
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/ipl/mumbai_indians              ## format the logical volume,  /dev/ipl/mumbai_indians  = Logical volume path
  mount /dev/ipl/mumbai_indians  /dev/wankhere   ## /dev/wankhere = location where logical volume mount
  lsblk or df -h                                 ## to check mount position

## If you want to EBS disk volume add with EC2 instance directly, First create a directory for mount location then format the disk and then mount the disk
   mkdir /mnt/disk_mount                         ## create mount location
   mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme3n1                     ## to format the dis volume , /dev/nvme3n1 = the disk volume which will mount
   mount /dev/nvme3n1 /dev/disk_mount            ## For mount the disk volume.
